Totally the met gala theme was amazing but the kardashians seem to have become a little too relaxed in the fashion world. people say that we should not criticize kylie for wearing that disaster because it was made by her late friend and she wore it in hois memory but she could have atleast stuck to the theme. kendalls dress was alright but what was up with her eyebrows,kim was puttin on her signature dress which is fine by us but i think she should really start to change that up a little bit before it gets old</p>

The fashion industry in recent times is being taken for a joke which is so uncool.People are putting on tyrash and calling it fashion. I will be at the next met gala scoping up dirt on the biggest celebrities and making fun of their fashion choices. Make sure you are there because you wouldn't wanna miss this. Its gonna be the biggest roast of thne decade.</p>
